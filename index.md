## About Me
I’m a senior at Stanford University pursuing a coterminal M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics alongside a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I’m interested in designing complex engineering systems and in how mechanics, thermal systems, materials, and controls come together across different applications.

My experience spans industry and research in Europe and the U.S., including work at MT Aerospace on ESA programs for in-orbit cryogenic fluid management and reusable launch technologies, as well as finite element analysis of advanced composites at Helicoid Industries. At Stanford, I’ve worked on plasma propulsion and advanced materials research, including a mycelium-based aerogel insulation project in collaboration with NASA.

More recently, shaped by my own experience as a patient, I’ve developed a strong interest in medical technology and accessible design. I’m currently working on a student project to develop an accessible aircraft boarding wheelchair to enable more independent air travel for passengers with disabilities.
