## About Me
I'm a senior at Stanford University pursuing a coterm degree: a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I’m broadly interested in designing complex engineering systems, with particular curiosity about how mechanics, thermal systems, materials, and controls interact to shape real-world performance across different applications.

I’ve gained experience across industry and academic settings in Europe and the U.S. This past summer, I worked as a Space Systems Engineering Intern at MT Aerospace in Germany, contributing to European Space Agency programs involving in-orbit cryogenic fluid transfer & management and reusable launch technologies. My work included system-level modeling, power and thermal trade studies and mission analysis. Previously, at Helicoid Industries, I focused on finite element analysis of advanced composite materials, developing custom constitutive models to study damage and failure behavior. At Stanford, my research has spanned plasma propulsion and advanced materials, including work on a mycelium-based aerogel insulation project in collaboration with NASA. 

More recently, through my own experience being a patient, I'm strongly interested in medical technology and accessible design. I’m currently working on a student project focused on developing an accessible aircraft boarding wheelchair, aimed at enabling more independent and dignified air travel for passengers with disabilities.
