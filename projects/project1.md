This project aims to improve accessibility in commercial air travel by designing a foldable, dual-mode manual wheelchair that enables users to independently board and deboard aircraft, navigate narrow aisles, and transfer into standard airplane seating with minimal assistance. Current boarding procedures require multiple transfers and reliance on airport staff, reducing user independence and dignity while increasing the risk of injury and wheelchair damage.

The approved design incorporates integrated linear-actuated struts with small wheels that elevate the wheelchair, allowing the user to remove the large rear wheels via an easy pin-release mechanism and operate in an aisle-mode configuration that fits within the 18-inch aircraft aisle. The wheelchair is designed to fold and stow in an overhead compartment, keeping the mobility device in the cabin. This allows passengers to deboard alongside the rest of the plane, eliminating long waits for gate-checked wheelchairs and reducing the risk of damage.

Supporting users up to 300 lb and complying with airline battery safety regulations, the design was selected through a structured concept evaluation over fully electric and modular alternatives. The concept was approved at the Concept Approval Review, three months into the project and will advance to detailed design, prototyping, and testing in the next three months.
