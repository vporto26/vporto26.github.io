# Fountain Hopper - Thrust Vector Controlled Hybrid Rocket 


## Description
I served as the project lead for the Fountain Hopper Rocket, a sub-team of the Stanford Student Space Initiative (SSI), focused on developing a vertically landing rocket using Thrust Vector Control (TVC). The team was designing and building a hybrid propulsion system to compete in the Collegiate Propulsive Lander Competition. Our work included detailed CAD development of critical engine components, such as the combustion chamber and nozzle, as well as the development of simulation and control software for the TVC system.

A significant portion of my contribution involved experimental structures work, particularly the design, fabrication, and testing of the thrust vector control and gimbal mechanisms. This hands-on testing validated structural integrity and directly informed design iterations. Significant knowledge and experience were gained through this project but due to project constraints and the large scope of the project, we, SSI, had to discontinue the project after three years.
